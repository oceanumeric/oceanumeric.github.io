This the second part of this series of posts as the title has stated. We
will continue to study the material from Cameron Musco's course - [Algorithms for Data Science](https://people.cs.umass.edu/~cmusco/CS514F22/index.html){:target="_blank"} {% cite musco2022 %}. This section assumes readers know what hash table is. If not, just check out 
[this video](https://youtu.be/Nu8YGneFCWE){:target="_blank"} from MIT.

When we use a random hash function $h(x)$ to map keys into hashing numbers,
we could design a fully random one which has the following property:

$$
\mathbb{P}(h(x) = i) = \frac{1}{n}
$$ 



However, wit the above property, we need to store a table of $x$ values and
their hash values. This would take at least $O(m)$ space and $O(m)$ query time
to look up, making our whole quest for $O(1)$ query time pointless. Therefore
we need to find another property that will avoid collision and $O(1)$ query
time. 


__2-Universial Hash Function__ (low collision probability). A random hash 
function from $h: U \to [n]$ is two universal if :

$$
\mathbb{P}[h(x) = h(y)] \leq \frac{1}{n} \tag{1}
$$

One of the functions that are often used is the following one: 

$$
h(x) = (a x + b \  \mathrm{mod} p) \  \mathrm{mod} \  n 
$$ 



__Pairwise Independent Hash Function.__ A random hash function from
$h: U \to [n]$ is pairwise independence if for all $i, j \in [n]$:

$$
\mathbb{P}[h(x) = i \cap h(y) = j] = \frac{1}{n^2} \tag{2}
$$

We can show that pairwise hash function are 2-universal. Now, for $i \in [n]$,
it has $n-1$ pairs and one pair with itself, therefore:

$$
\begin{aligned}
\mathbb{P}[h(x) = h(y)] & = \sum_{j=1}^n \mathbb{P}[h(x) = i \cap h(y) = j] \\
& = n \cdot \frac{1}{n^2} = \frac{1}{n}
\end{aligned}
$$


## Example 5: Randomized load balancing

We have $n$ requests _randomly_ assigned to $k$ servers. How many requests 
must each server handle? Let's assume $R_i$ as the number of requests 
assigned to server $i$. The expectation tells 

$$
\begin{aligned}
\mathbb{E}[R_i] & = \sum_{j=1}^n \mathbb{E} [ \mathbb{I}_{\text{request j assigned to i}}] \\
& = \sum_{j=1}^n \mathbb{P}(\text{j assigned to i}) \times 1  \\
& = \frac{n}{k} \tag{3}
\end{aligned}
$$

If we provision each server be able to handle twice  the expected load,
what is the probability that a server is overloaded? We can calculate it 
based on Markov's inequality:

$$
\mathbb{P}[R_j  > 2 \mathbb{E}[R_i]] \leq \frac{\mathbb{E}[R_i]}{2\mathbb{E}[R_i]} = \frac{1}{2}
$$


### Chebyshev's inequality 

With a very simple twist, Markovâ€™s inequality can be made
much more powerful. For any random variable $X$ and any value $t > 0$, we have: 

$$
\mathbb{P}(|X| \geq t ) = \mathbb{P}(X^2 \geq t^2 ) \leq \frac{\mathbb{E}[X^2]}{t^2}
$$

Now, by plugging in the random variable $X - \mathbb{E}$, we can hae 
Chebyshev's inequality.


__Chebyshev's inequality.__ For any random variable $X$ and $t > 0$,

$$
 \mathbb{P}(|X - E[X]| \geq t ) \leq \frac{\mathrm{Var}[X]}{t^2} \tag{4}
$$


With Chebyshev's inequality, we can calculate the probability that $X$
falls $s$ standard deviations from its mean as:

$$
\mathbb{P}(|X - E[X]| \geq s \cdot \sqrt{\mathrm{Var}[X]} ) \leq \frac{\mathrm{Var}[X]}{s^2\mathrm{Var}[X]} = \frac{1}{s^2} \tag{5}
$$

Equation (5) gives us the quick estimation on deviation of our estimations. It 
could also shows  that the sample average will always concentrate on 
mean with enough samples $n$ (law of large numbers). 

Consider drawing independent identically distributed (i.i.d) random variables
$X_1, \cdots, X_n$ with mean $\mu$ and variance $\sigma^2$. How well 
does the sample average 

$$ S = \frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^n X_i$$ 

approximate the true mean $\mu$?

First, we need to calculate the sample variance

$$
\mathrm{Var}[S] = \mathrm{Var} \left [ \frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^n X_i \right] = \frac{1}{n^2} \sum_{i=1}^n \mathrm{Var} [X_i] = \frac{1}{n^2} \cdot n \cdot \sigma^2 = \frac{\sigma^2}{n}
$$

By Chebyshev's inequality, for any fixed value $\epsilon > 0$, we have 

$$ 
\mathbb{P}( |S- \mu| \geq \epsilon) \leq \frac{\mathrm{Var}[S]}{\epsilon^2} = \frac{\sigma^2}{n \epsilon^2} \tag{5}
$$

Equation (6) could be used to estimate the size of sample we need for a certain
level of accuracy of the estimation. Instead of using $\epsilon$, we will use 
$\epsilon \cdot \sigma$, then we can have

$$ 
\mathbb{P}( |S- \mu| \geq \epsilon \cdot \sigma) \leq \frac{\mathrm{Var}[S]}{\epsilon^2 \sigma^2} = \frac{1}{n \epsilon^2} \tag{6}
$$

We can do quick estimation on sample size we need to achieve a certain level 
of estimation based on equation (6). Figure 1 shows that the probability 
of our sample mean deviating 10% percent of its variance is less or equal to
$0.1001$ when the sample size is greater than $100$, whereas the probability
is still bigger than 1 if we want our estimation with high accuracy ($\sigma = 0.01$),
which means that one needs a larger sample for that.

Now, back to our balancing load example, we have assumed that each server
could _be able to handle twice the expected load_ and the expected load 
is 

$$\mathbb{E}[R_j] = \frac{n}{k}$$ 

as it has been derived in equation (3) and we want to find the probability that a server is overloaded. We can use 
Chebyshev's inequality to calculate it. However, we need to calculate the 
variance first. Let's denote $R_{i, j}$ as $1$ if $j$ is assigned to 
server $i$ and $0$ otherwise, then 

$$
\begin{aligned}
\mathrm{Var}[R_{i,j}] & = \mathbb{E} \left [ (R_{i, j} - \mathbb{E}[R_{i,j}])^2 \right ] \\
& = \mathbb{P}(R_{i, j}= 1) \cdot (1 - \mathbb{E}[R_{i, j}])^2 + \mathbb{P}(R_{i,j} = 0)(0 - \mathbb{E}[R_{i, j}])^2 \\
& =\frac{1}{k} \cdot\left(1-\frac{1}{k}\right)^2+\left(1-\frac{1}{k}\right) \cdot\left(0-\frac{1}{k}\right)^2 \\
& =\frac{1}{k}-\frac{1}{k^2}  \\
& \leq \frac{1}{k}
\tag{7}
\end{aligned} 
$$

Now, with the _linearity of variance_, we can have 

$$ \mathrm{Var}[R_i] = \sum_{j=1}^n \mathrm{Var}[R_{i, j}]  \leq \frac{n}{k} $$ 


Now, with $\mathbb{E}[R_j] = \frac{n}{k}$ and $ \mathrm{Var}[R_i]  \leq \frac{n}{k}$,
we can apply Chebychev's inequality ($R_i$ is the number of requests sent to
server $i$)

$$
\begin{aligned}
\mathbb{P}(R_i \geq \frac{2n}{k})  & = \mathbb{P}(R_i - \frac{n}{k} \geq \frac{n}{k})  \\
& \leq  \mathbb{P}( |R_i - \frac{n}{k}| \geq \frac{n}{k}) \quad \text{(take absolute value)} \\
&  = \mathbb{P}( |R_i - | \mathbb{E}[R_j] \geq \frac{n}{k}) \\
& \leq \frac{ \mathrm{Var}[R_{i, j}]}{(n/k)^2} \\ 
& \leq \frac{k}{n} \tag{8}
\end{aligned}
$$

Equation (8) shows that overload probability is extremely small when
$k << n$,  which seems counterintuitive as it means bound gets worse as
$k$ grows (more servers do not help). When $k$ is large, the number of
requests each server sees in expectation is very small so the law of 
larger numbers does not 'kick in'. 

### Maximum server load 

We have shown the probability of one server overloaded in equation (8), now
we are interested in the probability of maximum server load exceeds its
capacity. To get the maximum server load, we need to have a list of servers 
that overloaded, this means not just one sever but possible many of them are
overloaded. The value of maximum load on any server can be written as the random variable:

$$S = \max_{i \in [1, \cdots, k]} R_i$$ 

How could we form a probability for $S \geq (2n)/k$ in terms of $R_i$?
Let's start from null case, which is that no $R_i$ is greater or equal to 
$(2n)/k$. For this kind of case, $S < (2n)/k$. Therefore, we need to have
at least one of $R_i$ is greater or equal to $(2n)/k$. On the other side,
if all of $R_i$ is greater or equal to $(2n)/k$, then there must be the case
that $S \geq (2n)k$. However, we do not need all of them. We can transform them
as the 'or' problem that guarantees the event $S$:

$$
\begin{aligned}
\mathbb{P}(S \geq \frac{2n}{k})  & = \mathbb{P} \left ( \left[ R_1 \geq \frac{2n}{k} \right ] \ \text{or} \ \left[ R_2 \geq \frac{2n}{k} \right ] \ \text{or} \ \cdots \ \text{or} \ \left[ R_k \geq \frac{2n}{k} \right ] \right ) \\
& = \mathbb{P} \left ( \cup_{i=1}^k \left[ R_i \geq \frac{2n}{k} \right ] \right )
\end{aligned}
$$

__Union Bound.__ For any random events $A_1, A_2, \cdots, A_k$, we have

$$
\mathbb{P}(A_1 \cup A_2 \cup \cdots \cup A_k) \leq \mathbb{P}(A_1) + \mathbb{P}(A_2) + \cdots + \mathbb{P}(A_k) \tag{9}
$$

With the union bound, it is easy to show 

$$
\begin{aligned}
\mathbb{P}(S \geq \frac{2n}{k})  & = \mathbb{P} \left ( \cup_{i=1}^k \left[ R_i \geq \frac{2n}{k} \right ] \right )  \\ 
& \leq \sum_{i=1}^k \mathbb{P}  \left ( \left[ R_i \geq \frac{2n}{k} \right ] \right ) \\ 
& \leq \sum_{i=1}^k \frac{k}{n} \\
& \leq \frac{k^2}{n}
\end{aligned}  
$$

This means as long as $k \leq O(\sqrt{n})$, with good probability, the 
maximum server load will be small (compared to the expected to load).
