title: Develop Some Fluency in Probabilistic Thinking
subtitle: The foundation of machine learning and data science is probability theory. In this post, we will develop some fluency in probabilistic thinking with different examples, which prepare data scientists well for the sexist job of the 21st century.

This post is very long. Therefore, we need a roadmap to guide us.
As it is shown in Figure 1, we will review some basic probability 
theories and prove some of them, then we will learn how those basic 
theories (especially those related to inequalities) could
help us to build models for solving real world problems, such as
algorithms for data science or machine learning models. Personally, I benefit
a lot from those examples because it shows me what is probabilistic thinking
and how power it is.
