title: Develop Some Fluency in Probabilistic Thinking
subtitle: The foundation of machine learning and data science is probability theory. In this post, we will develop some fluency in probabilistic thinking with different examples, which prepare data scientists well for the sexist job of the 21st century.

When I was studying probability theories, it was difficult for me
to see its application in real life until we enter a new era with 
all potential of machine learning and deep learning models. 
This post is to explain how those basic 
theories (especially those related to inequalities) could
help us for solving real world problems. Personally, I benefit
a lot from those examples because it shows me what is probabilistic thinking
and how power it is. Much of the content of this post is based on Cameron Musco's course - [Algorithms for Data Science](https://people.cs.umass.edu/~cmusco/CS514F22/index.html){:target="_blank"}.
