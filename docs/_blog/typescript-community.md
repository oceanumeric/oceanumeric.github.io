Over the last month, I have been exploring the Typescript community. The initial motivation is that I want to bring AI applications to the all
kinds of users. There are some frameworks in Python that can help me to do that, such as [Streamlit](https://www.streamlit.io/). However, I
found that the Typescript community is more active and has more mature frameworks.

Since those developers from Typescript community always focus on the user experience, they really did great jobs on some tools 

I will not go into the details of the Typescript community, but I will list some tools that I found useful.

- Sveltekit: a framework for building web applications
- Vite: a build tool for web applications
- Tailwindcss: a utility-first CSS framework
- Flowbite: a UI toolkit for building web applications
- Vercel: a cloud platform for static sites and serverless functions
- Supabase: an open source Firebase alternative
- Prisma: a database toolkit
- Lucia: a tiny library for authentification
- Superforms: a form builder for sveletekit
- Fly.io: a platform for running applications globally
- Railway: a platform for running applications instantly


I did not mention the most popular tools in the Typescript community, such as React, Next.js, Vue, and so on. I just want to list some tools that I think are useful for me who is a Python developer. 

I have tried the React and Next.js, but I found that Sveltekit is more suitable for me. I also did some applications with Vue, but I fell in love with Sveltekit, which blends the boundary between the frontend and backend.

It might take a while to get used to Sveltekit, but I think it is worth to try. Once you get used to it, you will find the following three things are really cool:

- `+page.svelte`: html, css, and js are in the same file (focusing on the design and presentation)
- `+page.ts`: typescript (focusing on the logic)
- `+page.server.ts`: typescript (focusing on the backend)

With the above three files, you can build very cool stuff. Together with Prisma, you can build a full-stack application in a very short time. Like the slogan of supbase, you can: __Build in a weekend, scale to millions.__


I am very happy to join the Typescript community. I will keep exploring the Typescript community and share my experience with you. Last year, I registered a domain called _pymeetsjs.com_. I think I should register another domain called _pymeetsts.com_.
