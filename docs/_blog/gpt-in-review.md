Ever since the release of GPT-3 by OpenAI, the world has been buzzing with excitement about the capabilities of large language models. I have used API from OpenAI to solve various tasks and developed some applications, such as [a cv job matching tool](https://www.beprepared.studio/){:target="_blank"} and [a firm search and profile generator tool](https://www.hypergi.com/firm-search){:target="_blank"} like perplexity search. 

I have heard many people told me that it is hard to scale the application with GPT models due to many reasons, such as the cost, the speed, and the performance. In this blog post, I will review the GPT models by OpenAI for certain tasks:

- Name Entity Recognition (NER) for news articles
- Summarization based on Goolge search results
- Ontology generation for a specific domain

I think overall, GPT models are great for many tasks, but querying time is a big issue.
