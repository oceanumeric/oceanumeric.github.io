It might be a bit late to do a review of the first quarter of 2023 at the end of April, but I think it is still worth doing. This is my first time to write a quarterly review, so I am not sure how it will go. I thought I will just write down my thoughts and see how it goes.

Checking my Github commit history shows that I have been working on my goals consistently throughout the quarter. Indeed, I am quite happy with my progress on getting deep into machine learning and deep learning. 

The release of ChatGPT in November 2022 has stirred up a lot of interest in AI and deep learning. In one of my previous posts, I have mentioned that I did not expect the advancement of AI to be so fast back in 2019. I took my first machine learning course in 2019 and soon I realized the potential of AI. That's why I decided to take a math degree in University College Dublin from 2019 to 2020. After working in a computer vision startup for a year, I switched to natural language processing (NLP) in 2021. 


In terms of NPL's development, two papers mark the history of AI:

- In 2013, a paper called _Distributed representations of words and phrases and their compositionality_ was published by Tomas Mikolov et al {% cite mikolov2013distributed %}
- In 2017, another paper called _Attention is all you need_ was published by Ashish Vaswani et al {% cite vaswani2017attention %}
- In 2023, literally, everyone is talking about ChatGPT.

## The importance of AI in 21st century

There are many books and articles that talk about the importance of AI in the 21st century. I found the the speech by Eric Schmidt, the former CEO of Google, to be very insightful when he gave a speech at Naval War College Foundation in May 2022.

In the above video, Eric outlined a vision in 5 to 10 years time where AI will be used in every aspect of our lives and its potential with synthetic biology. I don't know too much about synthetic biology, but I do agree with Eric that AI will be used in every aspect of our lives. 

In my mind, I image my children will have a personal AI assistant that will help them with their homework and learning. This AI assistant could be in the form of a robot or a hologram, like R2 in Star Wars. I thought it could be my life goal to build such an AI assistant for my children.


The speech given by Eric is on strategy level. The following video by Christopher Bishop, the former director of Microsoft Research Cambridge, is more technical. In the video, Christopher talked about the history of AI, and how the recent advancement in deep learning has changed the landscape of AI and changed people's way of thinking and working with computers.
