subtitle: There are many projects in the European Union that are funded by the European Research and Innovation Programme. To make sense of those projects and their results, we have to do lots of data processing and analysis.

On European level, the European Research and Innovation Program (H2020) is the main funding instrument for research and innovation. It is a very large program with a budget of 80 billion euros for the period 2014-2020. The program is divided into different parts, each with its own budget and focus. It is the consecutive program of FP7 (another large European research program). 

I have tried to make sense of those research program by analyzing the projects and their results, such as who are funded and what they do. This post will try to give an overview of those projects and construct a more structured dataset from the raw data for further analysis.


I have built a dataset and save it to Kaggle. One can follow [this link](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/oceanumeric/cordis){:target="_blank"} to download the dataset. 


## Projects and organizations 

Each research program has two datasets: projects and organizations. The projects dataset contains information about the projects, such as the title, the abstract, the budget, the start and end date, the project coordinator, the participants, the topics, the call, etc. The organizations dataset contains information about the organizations, such as the name, the country, the type, the address, etc.

The organizations dataset tells _who is involved_ in the projects. The projects dataset tells _what is done_ in the projects. The following code gives a glimpse of the projects dataset.

```R
project <- fread("./cordis/fp7/data/csv/project.csv")
str(project, width = 70,  strict.width = "cut")
# Classes ‘data.table’ and 'data.frame':	25785 obs. of  25 variables:

project %>%
    .[, totalCost := as.double(
        str_replace(totalCost, ",", ".")
        )] %>%
    .[, ecMaxContribution := as.numeric(
        str_replace(ecMaxContribution, ",", ".")
        )] %>%
    str()


# get start and end year
project %>%
    .[, startDate := as.IDate(startDate, "%Y-%m-%d")] %>%
    str()

# add project span in months, startYear, endYear
project %>%
    .[, projSpan := (interval(startDate, endDate) %/% months(1))] %>%
    str()

project %>%
    .[, startYear := year(startDate)] %>%
    .[, endYear := year(endDate)] %>%
    str()

# legalBasis group
project %>%
    .[, .N, by = legalBasis] %>%
    .[N > 10] %>%
    .[order(-rank(N))] %>%
    head(10) %>%
    kable("pipe")
```

The variable `legalBasis` tells us the theme of the project, for instance, 'FP7-SPACE' is about space technology. The following table gives an overview of the themes.

The above figure was produced by the following code.

```R
options(repr.plot.width = 9, repr.plot.height = 7)
project %>%
    .[grep("FP", legalBasis)] %>%
    .[, .(budget = sum(ecMaxContribution)/1e6), by = legalBasis] %>%
    .[, budget2 := as.character(round(budget, 0))] %>% 
    .[, budgetIndex := paste(legalBasis, budget2, sep = "\n")] %>%
    treemap(index = "budgetIndex",
            vSize = "budget",
            vColor = "budget",
            type = "manual",
            palette = "Blues",
            algorithm = "squarified",
            title = "Total EU Contribution in different programmes",
            title.legend = "million",
            fontsize.labels = c(10),  border.lwds = c(1, 1))
