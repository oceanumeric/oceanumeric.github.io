On European level, the European Research and Innovation Program (H2020) is the main funding instrument for research and innovation. It is a very large program with a budget of 80 billion euros for the period 2014-2020. The program is divided into different parts, each with its own budget and focus. It is the consecutive program of FP7 (another large European research program). 

I have tried to make sense of those research program by analyzing the projects and their results, such as who are funded and what they do. This post will try to give an overview of those projects and construct a more structured dataset from the raw data for further analysis.


I have built a dataset and save it to Kaggle. One can follow [this link](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/oceanumeric/cordis){:target="_blank"} to download the dataset. 


## Projects and organizations 

Each research program has two datasets: projects and organizations. The projects dataset contains information about the projects, such as the title, the abstract, the budget, the start and end date, the project coordinator, the participants, the topics, the call, etc. The organizations dataset contains information about the organizations, such as the name, the country, the type, the address, etc.

The organizations dataset tells _who is involved_ in the projects. The projects dataset tells _what is done_ in the projects. The following code gives a glimpse of the projects dataset for FP7 (the predecessor of H2020).

```R
project <- fread("./cordis/fp7/data/csv/project.csv")
str(project, width = 70,  strict.width = "cut")

### --------------- Clean the data ------------------ ###
# convert to numberic values 
project %>%
    .[, totalCost := as.double(
        str_replace(totalCost, ",", ".")
        )] %>%
    .[, ecMaxContribution := as.numeric(
        str_replace(ecMaxContribution, ",", ".")
        )] %>%
    str()


# get start and end year
project %>%
    .[, startDate := as.IDate(startDate, "%Y-%m-%d")] %>%
    str()

# add project span in months, startYear, endYear
project %>%
    .[, projSpan := (interval(startDate, endDate) %/% months(1))] %>%
    str()

project %>%
    .[, startYear := year(startDate)] %>%
    .[, endYear := year(endDate)] %>%
    str()

    .[N > 10] %>%
    .[order(-rank(N))] %>%
    head(10) %>%
    kable("pipe")
```

The variable `legalBasis` tells us the theme of the project, for instance, 'FP7-SPACE' is about space technology. The following table gives an overview of the themes.

<div class="table-figure-wrapper" markdown="block">

</div>

<div class='caption'>
        <span class='caption-label'>Figure 1.</span> The table gives the top 10 themes in terms of number of projects and the figure gives the distribution of the projects in terms of grant amount (in million euros). You can zoom in the figure by clicking on it.
</div>
</div>

The above table shows that the most popular theme is FP7-PEOPLE, which is about creating a more human society. The second most popular theme is FP7-IDEAS-ERC, which is about basic research. The third most popular theme is FP7-ICT, which is about information and communication technology. The fourth most popular theme is FP7-SME, which is about small and medium enterprises. 

In terms of the total grant amount, the most two popular themes are FP7-ICT and FP7-IDEAS-ERC, which receive around 7.7 and 7.8 billion euros respectively. Figure 1 was produced by the following code.

```R
options(repr.plot.width = 9, repr.plot.height = 7)
project %>%
    .[grep("FP", legalBasis)] %>%
    .[, .(budget = sum(ecMaxContribution)/1e6), by = legalBasis] %>%
    .[, budget2 := as.character(round(budget, 0))] %>% 
    .[, budgetIndex := paste(legalBasis, budget2, sep = "\n")] %>%
    treemap(index = "budgetIndex",
            vSize = "budget",
            vColor = "budget",
            type = "manual",
            palette = "Blues",
            algorithm = "squarified",
            title = "Total EU Contribution in different programmes",
            title.legend = "million",
            fontsize.labels = c(10),  border.lwds = c(1, 1))
``` 

Since there are many themes, we will focus on ICT, which is the one that receives the most grant amount. There are 2325 projects in the ICT theme, and the average project span is around 36 months (three years). The average grant amount is 4.8 million euros. However, the maximum grant amount is 74.98 million euros. The following table gives the summary statistics of the grant amount in the ICT theme, which shows that the grant amount is highly skewed. 

| Min. | 1st Qu. | Median | Mean | 3rd Qu. | Max.  |
|:----:|:-------:|:------:|:----:|:-------:|:-----:|
| 0.12 |  2.59   |  3.84  | 4.79 |  5.16   | 74.98 |

Like many variables in the business world, only the log of the grant amount is normally distributed. The following figure shows the distribution of the log of the grant amount in the ICT theme.

        <span class='caption-label'>Figure 2.</span> Histogram of the the grant amount and its log transformation in the ICT theme.

Here is the code to produce the above table and figure.

```R
project %>%
    .[legalBasis == "FP7-ICT"] %>%
    unique(by = "id") %>%
    with(summary(totalCost)/1000000) %>%
    as.matrix() %>% t() %>% 
    as.data.frame() %>%
    kable("pipe", align = "c", digits = 2)

options(repr.plot.width = 9, repr.plot.height = 5)
par(mfrow = c(1, 2))
hist(project$totalCost/1000000, breaks = 30, col = "grey",
                xlab = "Total Cost (million)",
                main = "Histogram of Total Cost")
hist(log(project$totalCost), breaks = 30, col = "grey",
                xlab = "Log(Total Cost)",
                main = "Histogram Log(Total Cost)")
```

Now, we will try to understand the topic of the projects in the ICT theme. The following table gives the top 10 words in the project titles in the ICT theme and wordclouds of the project titles in the ICT theme. 


<div class="table-figure-wrapper" markdown="block">

<div class='sub-figure'>
    <img src="/images/blog/fp7-title-wordcloud.png"

</div>

<div class='caption'>
        <span class='caption-label'>Figure 3.</span> The table gives the top 10 words in the project titles in the ICT theme and the figure gives the wordcloud of the project titles in the ICT theme.
</div>
</div>

As we can see that the top frequency words and wordclouds are not very informative. We will try to use the topic model to understand the topic of the projects in the ICT theme. The following code cleans the project objectives and gives the summary statistics of the number of words in the project objectives. 

```R
project %>%
    .[legalBasis == "FP7-ICT"] %>%
    unique(by = "id") %>%
    .[, .(objective)] %>% 
    # remove punctuation
    .[, objective := gsub("[[:punct:]]", "", objective)] %>%
    # remove control characters
    .[, objective := gsub("[[:cntrl:]]", "", objective)] %>%
    # to lower case
    .[, objective := tolower(objective)] %>%
    # remove numbers
    .[, objective := gsub("[[:digit:]]", "", objective)] %>%
    # remove stop words with tm package
    .[, objective := removeWords(objective, stopwords("english"))] %>%
    # strip white spaces
    .[, objective := stripWhitespace(objective)] %>%
    # stemming
    .[, objective := stemDocument(objective)] %>%
    # now we have the clean text data
    # we need to convert it to a document-term matrix
    # add document length
    .[, doc_length := str_count(objective, "\\S+")] -> project_doc

summary(project_doc$doc_length)
#  Min. 1st Qu.  Median    Mean 3rd Qu.    Max. 
#  28.0   166.0   177.0   174.8   186.0   318.0
```

The shortest project objective has 28 words, and the longest one has 318 words. The average project objective has 175 words. The following code creates a document-term matrix and a term-document matrix. We first drop the documents with less than 100 words in order to reduce the sparsity of the document-term matrix.

```R
# create a document-term matrix
# we will filter out documents with more than 100 words
# create document index
project_doc %>%
    .[doc_length >= 100] %>%
    .[, doc_id := .I] %>%
    # create a document-term matrix
    .[, .(doc_id, objective)] %>%
    unnest_tokens(word, objective) %>% 
    .[, .N, by = c("doc_id", "word")] %>%
    .[order(doc_id, -N)] %>% 
    as.data.frame() %>% 
    cast_dtm(doc_id, word, N) -> dtm_objective

# understand the document-term matrix
inspect(dtm_objective)

#   1925    5       2       1       1        0      2      3         1   2    4
#   1948    7       1       0       3        6      0      5         0   3    8
#   23      0       0       0       2        0      0      3         0   5    6
#   715     2       1       2       3        9      1      0         2   0    4
#   727     0       2       2       2        0      0      4         4   3    8
``` 

We have 2265 documents and 22694 terms in the document-term matrix. The table above shows the selected sample of the document-term matrix, which is a sparse matrix. Now, we will remove the terms that appear in less than 5 documents and more than 90% of the documents. Doing so will give us a collection of terms that are more informative, which balances the uniqueness and the commonality of the terms (i.e., the terms that are too unique or too common are not informative). 

```R
word_term <- findFreqTerms(dtm_objective,
                        lowfreq = 5,
                        highfreq = nrow(dtm_objective) * 0.9)

# create a new document-term matrix with the filtered words
dtm_objective_filtered <- dtm_objective[, word_term]
dtm_objective_filtered
# <<DocumentTermMatrix (documents: 2265, terms: 4851)>>
# Non-/sparse entries: 232500/10755015
# Sparsity           : 98%
# Maximal term length: 20
# Weighting          : term frequency (tf)
```

After dropping the terms that are too unique or too common, we have 4851 terms in the document-term matrix. The term-document matrix also becomes less sparse. 

Now, we will use the LDA model to understand the topics of the projects in the ICT theme. First, we need to define the number of topics. We will use a package called `ldatuning` to find the optimal number of topics. 

```R
lda_fit1 <- ldatuning::FindTopicsNumber(dtm_objective_filtered,
                                        topics = seq(2, 10),
                                        metrics = c("CaoJuan2009", "Deveaud2014"),
                                        method = "Gibbs",
                                        control = list(seed = 789),
                                        verbose = TRUE)

FindTopicsNumber_plot(lda_fit1)
```

<div class='figure'>
    <img src="/images/blog/lda-tuning-topicnum.png"
         alt="fp7 totalcost hist1"

    <div class='caption'>
        <span class='caption-label'>Figure 4.</span> the plot of the optimal number of topics based on the CaoJuan2009 and Deveaud2014 metrics.
    </div>
</div>


From the plot above, we will choose 9 as the optimal number of topics. The following code fits with LDA and plot the topics. 

```R
set.seed(789)
lda_fit2 <- LDA(dtm_objective_filtered, k = 9, method = "Gibbs",
                                        control = list(iter = 1000,
                                                        verbose = 50))

# get values of theta
options(repr.plot.width = 11, repr.plot.height = 9)
tidy(lda_fit2, matrix = "beta") %>% 
    group_by(topic) %>%
    slice_max(beta, n = 10) %>%
    ungroup() %>%
    arrange(topic, -beta) %>%
    mutate(word = reorder_within(term, beta, topic, sep="")) %>%
    ggplot(aes(word, beta, fill = factor(topic))) +
    geom_col(show.legend = FALSE, alpha = 0.85) +
    coord_flip() +
    facet_wrap(~topic, scales = "free") +
    labs(x = NULL, y = expression(beta)) +
    theme_bw() +
    # make x axis labels more readable with bold font
    theme(axis.text.y = element_text(face = "bold", size = 10),
            panel.grid.major = element_blank(),
            panel.grid.minor = element_blank())
```

By look at words in each topic, we can interpret the topics in Figure 5. For example, topic 1 is about quantum computing, topic 3 is probably about the smart manufacturing with mobile devices, and topic 6 is more about the economic policy on ICT.

        <span class='caption-label'>Figure 5.</span> the plot of topics based on the objectives of the projects in the ICT theme (you can click on the image to zoom in).
    </div>
</div>

I also found topic 4 and 9 are interesting. Topic 4 is about social media and topic 9 is about the platform for digital economy. 

Figure 5 shows that Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) is a useful tool to understand the topics of the projects in the ICT theme. The topics are not perfect, but they are useful to understand the projects in a very efficient way (assuming she/he will not read all the project objectives by herself/himself).

With those 9 topics we classified, we can now answer the following questions:

1. What are the most popular topics in the ICT theme?
2. Which topic receives the most funding?


<div class='figure'>
    <img src="/images/blog/fp7-topics-hist1.png"

</div>

Figure 6 shows that there are more or less equal number of projects in each topic. The most popular topic is topic 1, which is about quantum computing. The following table shows the top 10 topics in terms of the total cost of the projects and the average cost of the projects in each topic.


|topic |totalCost(million) |avrgCost(million) |
|:-----|:---------:|:--------:|
|3     |1747.42   |5.64     |

|6     |726.44    |2.34     |
|2     |302.68    |4.39     |

We can see that European Commission invests more in topic 3, which is about smart manufacturing and energy with mobile devices. In general, topic 3 is all about using ICT to improve the efficiency of the manufacturing, transportation, and energy sectors. The following table gives some sample projects in topic 3.
