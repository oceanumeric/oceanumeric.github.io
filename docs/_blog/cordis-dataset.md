The Community Research and Development Information Service (CORDIS) is the European Commission's primary source of results from the projects funded by the EU's framework programs for research and innovation, from FP1 to Horizon Europe.

I have downloaded the following datasets:

- CORDIS - EU research projects under FP5 (1998-2002)
- CORDIS - EU research projects under FP6 (2002-2006) 
- CORDIS - EU research projects under FP7 (2007-2013)
- CORDIS - EU research projects under Horizon 2020 (2014-2020)
- CORDIS - EU research projects under HORIZON EUROPE (2021-2027)

You can download all datasets from [kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/oceanumeric/cordis){:target="_blank"}.
