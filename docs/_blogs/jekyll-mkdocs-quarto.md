If you want to create a website to organize your writings, technological
notes, research ideas, etc., you might struggle over choosing different 
frameworks to do a 'proper' job. Here are some well-known frameworks 
in this business: Hexo, Hugo, Jekyll, Mkdocs, Quarto, R Markdown, Jupyter Book
You name it! 

There are many posts talking about pros and cons for each framework, here
are some of them:

- [We don't talk about Quarto](https://www.apreshill.com/blog/2022-04-we-dont-talk-about-quarto/){:target="_blank"}
- [Jekyll vs Hugo vs Mkdocs](http://make.waaglabs.nl/fablab/interns/2019/michelle-vossen/other/2019/10/24/comparison-of-static-website-generators.html){:target="_blank"}
- [Porting a distill blog to quarto](https://blog.djnavarro.net/posts/2022-04-20_porting-to-quarto/){:target="_blank"}
- [Enable Blogging Capabilities with Material for MkDocs](https://www.dirigible.io/blogs/2021/11/2/material-blogging-capabilities/#overriding-the-content-block){:target="_blank"}

Over the last five years, I have tried Hugo with academic theme, Mkdocs with 
material theme, R Bookdown, etc. In the end, I chose Jekyll over Mkdocs with 
material theme. Why?

First, the performance score of Mkdocs with material theme is not very good.
Even though it does have fantastic plugins like `mkdocs-jupyter`, it makes
the website and each post become heavy. The following figure gives
the lighthouse performance score of landing page of my old website built
with Mkdocs Material.

Things get worse when I tried to write a mathematical blogs. Figure 2 speaks 
for itself.

## Rendering math fast 

{% katexmm %}

Since many of my posts include lots of math equations. I have to make sure
the page will be rendered smoothly. With `Jupyter Notebook`, only `MathJax 2.7`
is supported, which makes it very slow when your post grows bigger. For example,
no one could finish reading [this post](https://nbviewer.org/github/oceanumeric/Applied-Mathematics/blob/main/volume1/Linear-Systems-and-Floating-Point-Arithmetic.ipynb){:target="_blank"} without
being distracted. 

I have tried to build up my own framework by leveraging `nbconvert`, which
does have some functions to make the post become clean, such as hiding
`In[], Out[]` in the post, providing `copy button` for the code block. However,
keeping the style consistent and pre-rendering math equation become very
difficult and time consuming. I did manage to render math equations on the
server side by using `mathjax-node-page`(here is the [repo](https://github.com/oceanumeric/nbtransfer){:target="_blank"}
if you want to do the same thing.). It turned out this issue is more
general than I thought {% cite fedorin joashc%}. 

Regards rendering math online, there are many options. Readers are recommended
checking those [demos](https://bourne2learn.com/math/){:target="_blank"}. In
the end, I was nudged to chose Jekyll because of the plugin 
[jekyll-katex](https://github.com/linjer/jekyll-katex){:target="_blank"} 
allows me to render math on server-side easily. The theme of this blog was
taken from Gundersen's blog {% cite Gundersen %}.  

Here are some examples of rendering math equations in the post. 

__Variance of the sum of multiple random variables.__ For random variables $X_i$
we have:

$$\text{Var}\left(\sum_{i=1}^{n}X_{i}\right)=\sum_{i=1}^{n}\sum_{j=1}^{n}\text{Cov}\left(X_{i},X_{j}\right)$$

Using the decomposition formula of variance, we have

$${\rm var} \left( \sum_{i=1}^{n} X_i \right) = E \left( \left[ \sum_{i=1}^{n} X_i \right]^2 \right) - \left[ E\left( \sum_{i=1}^{n} X_i \right) \right]^2$$

Now note that $(\sum_{i=1}^{n} a_i)^2 = \sum_{i=1}^{n} \sum_{j=1}^{n} a_i a_j$, 
which is clear if you think about what you're doing when you calculate 

$$(a_1+...+a_n) \cdot (a_1+...+a_n),$$

by hand. Therefore,

$$E \left( \left[ \sum_{i=1}^{n} X_i \right]^2 \right) = E \left( \sum_{i=1}^{n} \sum_{j=1}^{n} X_i X_j \right) = \sum_{i=1}^{n} \sum_{j=1}^{n} E(X_i X_j)$$

similarly,

$$\left[ E\left( \sum_{i=1}^{n} X_i \right) \right]^2 = \left[ \sum_{i=1}^{n} E(X_i) \right]^2 = \sum_{i=1}^{n} \sum_{j=1}^{n} E(X_i) E(X_j)
$$

So,

$${\rm var} \left( \sum_{i=1}^{n} X_i \right) = \sum_{i=1}^{n} \sum_{j=1}^{n} \big( E(X_i X_j)-E(X_i) E(X_j) \big) = \sum_{i=1}^{n} \sum_{j=1}^{n} {\rm cov}(X_i, X_j)$$

__Pairwise independence.__ In general:

$$\text{Var}\left(\sum_{i=1}^{n}X_{i}\right)=\sum_{i=1}^{n}\sum_{j=1}^{n}\text{Cov}\left(X_{i},X_{j}\right)$$

If $X_i$ and $X_j$ are independent then $\mathbb{E}X_{i}X_{j}=\mathbb{E}X_{i}\mathbb{E}X_{j}$
and consequently

$$\text{Cov}\left(X_{i},X_{j}\right):=\mathbb{E}X_{i}X_{j}-\mathbb{E}X_{i}\mathbb{E}X_{j}=0
$$

This leads to:

$$\text{Var}\left(\sum_{i=1}^{n}X_{i}\right)=\sum_{i=1}^{n}\text{Var}X_{i}
$$



## Set up the website

Unlike python's community, the tutorial documents for setting up
a website with `Github Pages` are not very easy to follow. It took me
a while to set up this website. Since all static site generators
are to organize files and templates, one has to understand how `Jekyll`
organize your markdown files and templates of themes. Now, let's generate
a static website step by step. 

- Step 1: Check ruby version `ruby -v` and make sure ruby installed

- Step 2: Install Jekyll `gem install bundler jekyll`; if you see errors like 
followings:

```
ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'apt_pkg'
ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'apt_inst'
```
This means you need link your packages:


```bash 
# go to the package folder
cd /usr/lib/python3/dist-packages
# check apt_pkg version
ls -l | grep apt_pkg
# check apt_inst version
ls -l | grep apt_inst
# link the package for your version
sudo cp apt_pkg.cpython-38-x86_64-linux-gnu.so apt_pkg.so
sudo cp apt_inst.cpython-38-x86_64-linux-gnu.so apt_inst.so
```

- Step 3: Create a repository called `<your-github-username>.github.io` 

- Step 4: Clone your repository and create a folder called `docs` within
this repository

```bash
cd github-repository
# you can call it something else, but docs is a good folder name 
mkdir docs 
cd docs 
# create the jekyll website
jekyll new . 
```

- Step 5: Understand the structure of your website

Generally, you have two kinds of folders:

1. folders with underscore like `_layouts`
2. folders without underscore like `images` and `assets` 

```bash
.
â”œâ”€â”€ index.markdown  # home page - index 
â”œâ”€â”€ _config.yml  # manager the configure options 
â”œâ”€â”€ Gemfile  # manager the ruby environment 
â”œâ”€â”€ Gemfile.lock  # lock the environment 
â”œâ”€â”€ 404.html
â”œâ”€â”€ about.markdown  # another landing page if you need it
â”œâ”€â”€ assets  # js file 
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ katex.min.js
â”œâ”€â”€ css  # css files 
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ blog.css
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ main.css
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ markdown.css
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ trac.css
â”œâ”€â”€ images  # images for your website 
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ blog
â”‚   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ mkdocs1.png
â”‚   â”‚   â””â”€â”€ mkdocs2.png
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ favicon.png
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ inclusion-exclusion.png
â”œâ”€â”€ blog  # blog section 
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ index.html
â”œâ”€â”€ _blogs  # all blogs 
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ example.md
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ jekyll-mkdocs-quarto.md
â”œâ”€â”€ _bibliography
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ references.bib
â”œâ”€â”€ _includes  # header and nav templates 
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ header.html
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ nav.html
â”œâ”€â”€ _layouts  # layout template for different sections 
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ blog_default.html
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ default.html
â””â”€â”€ _site  # built site contents goes into this folder
```

Let's say you want to build up a section or portfolio for your
website called `teaching` section. Then you need:

1. `teaching` folder to set up the landing page
2. `_teaching` folder to store different contents
3. a html file in `_layout` folder if you want a different layout 

To learn how this website was built, please visit my [repo](https://github.com/oceanumeric/oceanumeric.github.io){:target="_blank"}. 

- Step 6: Install plugins and configure them in `_config.yml` file. 

- Step 7: Set up CICD (Github Actions)

Here is my CICD file in `.github/workflows`: 

```yml
name: Build and Deploy My Jekyll Site to GitHub Pages

on:
  push:
    branches:
      - main

jobs:
  jekyll:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    permissions:
      contents: write

    steps:
      - name: ðŸ“‚ setup github actions 
        uses: actions/checkout@v2
      
      # setup ruby environment 
      - name: ðŸ’Ž setup ruby
        uses: ruby/setup-ruby@v1
        with:
          ruby-version: 3.1.2

      - name: ðŸ”¨ install dependencies & build site
        uses: limjh16/jekyll-action-ts@v2
        with:
          enable_cache: true

      - name: ðŸš€ deploy
        uses: peaceiris/actions-gh-pages@v3
        with:
          github_token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
          publish_dir: ./_site
```
