If you want to create a website to organize your writings, technological
notes, research ideas, etc., you might struggle over choosing different 
frameworks to do a 'proper' job. Here are some well-known frameworks 
in this business: Hexo, Hugo, Jekyll, Mkdocs, Quarto, R Markdown, Jupyter Book
You name it! 

There are many posts talking about pros and cons for each framework, here
are some of them:

- [We don't talk about Quarto](https://www.apreshill.com/blog/2022-04-we-dont-talk-about-quarto/){:target="_blank"}
- [Jekyll vs Hugo vs Mkdocs](http://make.waaglabs.nl/fablab/interns/2019/michelle-vossen/other/2019/10/24/comparison-of-static-website-generators.html){:target="_blank"}
- [Porting a distill blog to quarto](https://blog.djnavarro.net/posts/2022-04-20_porting-to-quarto/){:target="_blank"}
- [Enable Blogging Capabilities with Material for MkDocs](https://www.dirigible.io/blogs/2021/11/2/material-blogging-capabilities/#overriding-the-content-block){:target="_blank"}

Over the last five years, I have tried Hugo with academic theme, Mkdocs with 
material theme, R Bookdown, etc. In the end, I chose Jekyll over Mkdocs with 
material theme. Why?

First, the performance score of Mkdocs with material theme is not very good.
Even though it does have fantastic plugins like `mkdocs-jupyter`, it makes
the website and each post become heavy.
