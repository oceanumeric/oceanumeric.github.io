        <p>Before you started, I promise you that this post is about AI. So you do not have to worry that you might use your time reading something unnecessary or something not as powerful or excited as AI. This post is indeed about AI, Neural Networks, and ChatGPT.</p>

<p>If you ask me what I am living for, I would say that I live for the peace, especially
the peace of mind. Without the inner peace, I could not focus on my work, and I could
not enjoy my life. For anyone who has the certain level of life experience, 
she or he could soon realize that the peace of mind is the most important thing in life. Take learning Guitar or Piano or Playing football or badminton as an example,
one could hardly improve her or his skills if she or he is not in the peace of mind. The more anxious we are, the less flexible our body will become and the less
creative our mind will be.</p>

<p>But what is the inner peace? No one summarized it better than Bruce Lee, who said that
the inner peace is the absence of self-opposition. The self-opposition is the conflict
between our mind and our body. If our body was driven by feelings and instincts, our
mind was driven by the rationality and logic. The conflict between the two is the
self-opposition. The self-opposition is the source of all the anxiety and the stress.</p>

<p>When you reached this paragraph, you might wonder why we are talking about Bruce Lee
when the title of this article is about Steve Jobs. The reason is that they represent
the same thing. All those talks sound very like Chinese philosophy, but we put it into the context of the western culture, it can be expressed by words of John 8:31-32 in the Bible: “If you hold to my teaching, you are really my disciples. Then you will know the truth, and the truth will set you free.” What is the truth? The truth is freedom and freedom of self-opposition.</p>

<p>Please watch the following video, it is only 3 minutes long.</p>

<div align="center">
<iframe width="100%" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/nzQWYHHqvIw?si=RrJvQHCwVyeleSV4" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</div>

<p>Let me quote from Bruce Lee again:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>It’s the combination of both; here it is the natural instinct, here is the control. You are to combine the two in harmony. If you have one (the instinct) to the extreme, you will be very unscientific. If you have another to the extreme, you become, all of the sudden, a mechanical man, no longer a human being.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Let’s see the second part of the video. This is one of my favorite parts of the video. We all agree that Steve Jobs has his own style. But what
is the style?</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>But if you do not have style, if you just say, “here I am as a human being, how can I express myself totally and completely?” Now, that way you won’t create a style, because style is a crystallization, you know, I mean, that way, it’s a process of continuing growth.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>With the above philosophy, we can embark on the reading as follows:</p>

<h2 id="why-i-want-to-learn-from-steve-jobs">Why I want to learn from Steve Jobs</h2>

<p>Over the last few months, I have been trying to build up a path to be involved
in the AI industry like many other people are doing. After practicing all sorts 
of things in this industry, such as coding the models, talking with business people,
and creating different kinds of applications, I realized that I need a strategy
to guide me through the process.</p>

<p>This strategy will not only help me to be successful in the AI industry, but also
give me a sense of direction in my life, which in the end, it should bring me 
the peace of mind. Without a sense of direction and the inner peace, no one could
transfer her/his passion into the real value.</p>

<p>This the first reason why I want to learn from Steve Jobs. The second reason is that
he has a huge experience in the industry, which in the end, gives him the 
insights of the industry. By learning from him, hopefully I could see how
the AI industry will evolve in the future.</p>

    </div>
</div>

<p>I will list the things that I have learned from Steve Jobs one by one.</p>

<h3 id="1-you-need-to-follow-your-heart-and-have-your-passion">1. You need to follow your heart and have your passion</h3>

<blockquote>
  <p>The most important thing now I think is that if you are gonna start something new, you have to feel passion about it. It’s so hard to start a company, if you are not passion about it, you will give it up.</p>
</blockquote>

</div>

<p><strong>My reflection:</strong> <em>making money is different from starting a company. There are many ways of making money without starting a company. Think about what you really want and what kind of things you are passion about and what kind of things you want to do for having the peace of mind when you are doing it.</em></p>

<h3 id="2-its-lucky-to-find-what-you-want-fits-what-the-market-needs">2. It’s lucky to find what you want fits what the market needs</h3>

<blockquote>
  <p>We did not plan to build a company. We were building computers for us and our friends to use it. And we found out that many people wanted to buy them. So we started a company to manufacture them.</p>
</blockquote>

<div align="center">
<iframe width="100%" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/0lvMgMrNDlg?si=ed91bxCMeEGsdWtC&amp;start=152" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</div>

<p><strong>My reflection:</strong> <em>The “great man”, the “hero”, or the “genius” just grows out of
his time and land, is the product of and symbol of events as well as their agent and voices; without some situation requiring a new response his new ideas
would be untimely and impracticable. When he is a hero of action, the demands 
of his position and the exaltation of crisis develop and inflate him to such magnitude
and powers as would in normal times have remained potential and untapped. Heroes are
effects of numberless causes, and causes of endless effects.</em></p>

<h3 id="3-the-third-great-age-of-personal-computing">3. The Third great age of personal computing</h3>

<blockquote>
  <p>The first great age of personal computing was around 1980s, and that was the age of productivity tools, such as spreadsheets, word processors, and databases. That primarily benefits the business. The second great age of personal computing was around 1990s, and that was the age of the internet and the web. For this age, not just the business people could benefit, normal people could benefit too. And the third great age of personal computing is around 2010s, and that is the age of the mobile devices.</p>
</blockquote>

<div align="center">
<iframe width="100%" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/-Z9cFdhHKB4?si=hoqHhLf9zvbkguRc&amp;start=55" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</div>

<p><strong>My reflection:</strong> <em>The fourth great age of personal computing is probably the age of AI. But how this age will be different from the previous three ages? Right now,
it is still hard to tell. Based on my experience, it will be for sure the tool
for the business people, especially those who are in the business of the data and
the information. But it will also benefit the normal people, just like the internet
and the web did. We will see.</em></p>

<h3 id="4-combine-the-technology-and-humanities">4. Combine the technology and humanities</h3>

<blockquote>
  <p>There are lots of forces in our life that tend to finalizes us down into the institutionalized path. And where people sometimes forget that they are unique and they have feelings. And again, the whole computer industry is trying to forget there are human inside and just try to focus on technology… But we think there is whole another side of the coin, that is what you will do with those things? Can we help you to express yourself in a richer way?</p>
</blockquote>

<div align="center">
<iframe width="100%" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/-Z9cFdhHKB4?si=Ao2vn9hRu3Zozyfg&amp;start=436" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</div>

<p><strong>My reflection:</strong> <em>The technology is the tool, and the humanities is the goal. The technology is the means, and the humanities is the end. Without serving for the
great humanities, companies could not grow big. Both Bruce Lee and Steve Jobs mentioned how we could express ourselves. If you think about that, instagram and TikTok must succeed as they provide ways for people to express themselves.</em></p>

<h3 id="5-great-products-are-the-key-to-the-success-of-the-company">5. Great products are the key to the success of the company</h3>

<blockquote>
  <p>You need great products that you and your friends want to use it and they will help you to do marketing as well. If one customer loves your product, he will tell 100 people about it.</p>
</blockquote>

<div align="center">
<iframe width="100%" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/GnO7D5UaDig?si=RO6i0PnENJaSiswZ&amp;start=1692" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</div>

<p><strong>My reflection:</strong> <em>We need to transfer our passion into great products.</em></p>

<h3 id="6-being-thinker-and-doer-in-one-person">6. Being thinker and doer in one person</h3>

<blockquote>
  <p>My entire life has been spent in one industry - which is this one. My key observation is that the doers are the major thinkers, the people who really create things that change the industry are those who are thinkers and doers in one person.</p>
</blockquote>

<div align="center">
<iframe width="100%" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/oNC8LEj5X4U?si=ezoPWD5U_kNMJVJK&amp;start=2229" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</div>

<p><strong>My reflections:</strong> theory and practices have to come together.</p>

<h3 id="7-his-vision-of-chatgpt">7. His vision of ChatGPT</h3>

<blockquote>
  <p>When I look at the personal computer, where you know we are living in the wake of the last revolution which was the new source of free energy, that was the free energy of petrochemicals and completely transformed our society and we are products of petrochemicals revolution and we are still living the wake of today. We are not entering another revolution of free energy.. it’s free intellectual energy, it is crude and very crude but it is getting more refined and year after year; and in our lifetimes it should get very refined…my hope is someday when the next Aristotle is alive we can capture the underlying worldview of that Aristotle in a computer and someday some students will be able to not only read the words of Aristotle but ask Aristotle a question and get an answer. That’s what I hope we can do. This is a beginning of that. It will happen in 20 years.</p>
</blockquote>

<div align="center">
<iframe width="100%" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/2qLuerYx2IA?si=QR5PxaFrWzgCzHM6&amp;start=298" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</div>

<p><strong>My reflections:</strong> <em>It happens today in 2022. The ChatGPT is the beginning of that, which is 20 years later than Steve Jobs predicted. But it is still a beginning.</em></p>

<h3 id="8-stay-with-your-customers-and-your-passion">8. Stay with your customers and your passion</h3>

<blockquote>
  <p>We had historically a very hard time to figuring out exactly who our customers are…but we have noticed that there is the second half is emerging and we call them professional half; there are some submarkets such as publishing, medical, a lot of database-drive applications, education, etc.</p>
</blockquote>

<div align="center">

</div>

<p><strong>My reflections:</strong> <em>Stay close to your customers and your passion. Please know the numbers and the best marketing is the education, which you show your customer who you are, what you are passionate about, and then teach them how they could express themselves like you do.</em></p>

<h3 id="9-being-focuses-is-to-say-no">9. Being focuses is to say no</h3>

<div align="center">
<iframe width="100%" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/H8eP99neOVs?si=gojai7g0wzpJzolT&amp;start=298" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</div>

<h2 id="whats-my-strategy-for-getting-involved-in-the-ai-industry-then">What’s my strategy for getting involved in the AI industry then?</h2>

<p>Now, things are very clear and I could have my peace. This is what I am going to do:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Follow my heart and have my passion</li>
  <li>Create great products</li>
  <li>Find my customers and stay with them</li>
  <li>Be a thinker and doer in one person</li>
  <li>Combine the technology and humanities</li>
  <li>Be focused and say no to the things that are not important to me</li>
</ul>

<p>What will be the first products that I will create? That will leave to me and my friends to decide.</p>
