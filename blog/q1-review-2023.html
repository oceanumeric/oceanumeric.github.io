    </div>
</div>

<p>Checking my Github commit history shows that I have been working on my goals consistently throughout the quarter. Indeed, I am quite happy with my progress on getting deep into machine learning and deep learning.</p>

<p>The release of ChatGPT in November 2022 has stirred up a lot of interest in AI and deep learning. In one of my previous posts, I have mentioned that I did not expect the advancement of AI to be so fast back in 2019. I took my first machine learning course in 2019 and soon I realized the potential of AI. That’s why I decided to take a math degree in University College Dublin from 2019 to 2020. After working in a computer vision startup for a year, I switched to natural language processing (NLP) in 2021.</p>

<p>In terms of NPL’s development, two papers mark the history of AI:</p>

<ul>
  <li>In 2013, a paper called <em>Distributed representations of words and phrases and their compositionality</em> was published by Tomas Mikolov et al <a class="citation" href="#mikolov2013distributed">(Mikolov et al., 2013)</a></li>
  <li>In 2017, another paper called <em>Attention is all you need</em> was published by Ashish Vaswani et al <a class="citation" href="#vaswani2017attention">(Vaswani et al., 2017)</a></li>
  <li>In 2023, literally, everyone is talking about ChatGPT.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="the-importance-of-ai-in-21st-century">The importance of AI in 21st century</h2>

<p>There are many books and articles that talk about the importance of AI in the 21st century. I found the the speech by Eric Schmidt, the former CEO of Google, to be very insightful when he gave a speech at Naval War College Foundation in May 2022.</p>

<div align="center">
<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/7XqQZf09O-U" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</div>

<p>In the above video, Eric outlined a vision in 5 to 10 years time where AI will be used in every aspect of our lives and its potential with synthetic biology. I don’t know too much about synthetic biology, but I do agree with Eric that AI will be used in every aspect of our lives.</p>

<p>In my mind, I image my children will have a personal AI assistant that will help them with their homework and learning. This AI assistant could be in the form of a robot or a hologram, like R2 in Star Wars. I thought it could be my life goal to build such an AI assistant for my children.</p>

<p>The speech given by Eric is on strategy level. The following video by Christopher Bishop, the former director of Microsoft Research Cambridge, is more technical. In the video, Christopher talked about the history of AI, and how the recent advancement in deep learning has changed the landscape of AI and changed people’s way of thinking and working with computers.</p>
