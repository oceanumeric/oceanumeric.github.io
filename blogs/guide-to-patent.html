        <p>The first question came to my mind was “<em>where should I start?</em>” when I
wanted to do patent analytics for my research project. Like everyone, I
ended up with Google or ChatGPT (if you got a chance to ask there). I found 
out that the EPO Worldwide Patent Statistical Database (PATSTAT) 
is one of the most widely used patent databases for researchers and business
analytics. However, PATSTAT is not free and one has to pay for it. Even
you had bought PATSTAT, you still need a guide to working with it.</p>

<p>Reading this guide will save you days to working with patent data. hello hsdg</p>

<h2 id="knowing-the-data">Knowing the data</h2>

<p>Paper by <a class="citation" href="#kang2016patstat">(Kang &amp; Tarasconi, 2016)</a> presented the examples of frequently used patent
statistics explained in the following table.</p>

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>Analysis</th>
      <th>Patent statistics</th>
      <th>Purposes</th>
    </tr>

      <td>Citation analysis</td>
      <td>Forward citations</td>

<p>In terms of discussed advantages and disadvantages of using PATSTAT data, they
made a summary as follows:</p>

<ul>
  <li>advantage
    <ul>
      <li>Databases based on and linkable to PATSTAT have been produced by other institutions</li>
      <li>In comparing the characteristics of PATSTAT with the NBER Patent Database of the US Patent data, PATSTAT provides information that are not available in the other two databases such as priority and continuing applications.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>disadvantage
    <ul>
      <li>There is a large proportion of missing information in inventors’ geographic data</li>
      <li>PATSTAT has a European-centered bias</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>There are three most critical issues that users must recognize when planning to use PATSTAT  <a class="citation" href="#kang2016patstat">(Kang &amp; Tarasconi, 2016)</a>:</p>

<ol>
  <li>users need to harmonize names of applicants and inventors; for example, Toyota Motor Corporation appears as “Toyota Motor Corporation,” “Toyota Motor Co,” “Toyota Jidosha Kabushiki Kaisha” (“Jidosha” and “Kabushiki Kaisha” mean a car and a corporation in Japanese, respectively), “Toyota Jidosha K. K.,” and so on.</li>
  <li>users need to be aware of the case that one entity can appear with different names in patent documents.</li>
  <li>users need to understand how EPO records and tracks its documents, especially when those documents are from different patent offices, such as USPTO.</li>
</ol>

<p>With those background information, I believe you are well prepared to start working
with some datasets now.</p>
